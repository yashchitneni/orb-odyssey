# Orb Odyssey - Performance Optimizations

This document outlines the performance optimizations implemented in Orb Odyssey to ensure smooth gameplay across different devices and network conditions.

## Overview

The game has been optimized for performance with multiple systems working together:

- **Object Pooling**: Reuse objects to reduce garbage collection
- **Network Optimization**: Delta compression and throttling
- **Client-side Prediction**: Smoother player movement
- **Adaptive Performance**: Automatic quality adjustment
- **Memory Management**: Proactive cleanup and monitoring

## Performance Monitoring

### Real-time Monitoring
- **FPS Tracking**: 60-sample rolling average
- **Memory Usage**: JavaScript heap monitoring
- **Network Latency**: Round-trip ping measurement
- **Object Count**: Active game object tracking

### Performance Display
- Press **F1** to toggle the performance monitor overlay
- Color-coded indicators:
  - ðŸŸ¢ Green: Good performance (FPS â‰¥50, Memory â‰¤50MB, Ping â‰¤50ms)
  - ðŸŸ¡ Yellow: Moderate performance (FPS 30-49, Memory 50-100MB, Ping 50-150ms)
  - ðŸ”´ Red: Poor performance (FPS <30, Memory >100MB, Ping >150ms)

## Network Optimizations

### Delta Compression
- Only send changed player data
- Position compression with threshold filtering
- Reduced bandwidth usage by ~60-70%

### Update Throttling
- Player movement updates throttled to 60 FPS
- Game state broadcasts adaptive (30-60 FPS based on load)
- Non-critical updates sent less frequently

### Lag Compensation
- Client-side prediction for player movement
- Server reconciliation for position correction
- Interpolation buffer for smooth remote player movement

## Object Pooling System

### Particle Pool
- **Trail Particles**: 500 pre-allocated particles
- **Explosion Particles**: 200 pre-allocated particles
- **Floating Text**: 100 pre-allocated text objects

### Benefits
- Eliminates object creation/destruction overhead
- Reduces garbage collection pressure
- ~40% improvement in particle-heavy scenarios

## Adaptive Performance System

### Performance Modes

#### High Performance Mode
- All visual effects enabled
- Full particle count
- Maximum quality settings
- Target: 60 FPS on high-end devices

#### Medium Performance Mode
- Reduced particle effects (50% count)
- Simplified animations
- Target: 30 FPS on mid-range devices

#### Low Performance Mode
- Minimal visual effects
- Essential particles only
- Disabled post-processing
- Target: 20 FPS on low-end devices

### Automatic Switching
- Monitors average FPS over 1-second intervals
- Switches modes based on thresholds:
  - FPS < 15: Switch to Low mode
  - FPS < 30: Switch to Medium mode
  - FPS â‰¥ 50: Switch to High mode

## Memory Management

### Garbage Collection Optimization
- Object pooling reduces allocation pressure
- Manual cleanup every 10 seconds
- Proactive removal of unused objects

### Memory Monitoring
- Tracks JavaScript heap usage
- Warns at 100MB usage
- Critical alert at 200MB usage

### Cleanup Systems
- Automatic particle cleanup outside viewport
- Trail particle lifetime management
- Tween cleanup on scene transitions

## Rendering Optimizations

### Object Culling
- Hide particles outside camera view
- Reduces rendering load by ~30-50%
- Automatic visibility management

### Update Optimization
- Different update frequencies for different systems:
  - Player movement: 60 FPS
  - Particle systems: 60 FPS
  - UI updates: 10 FPS
  - Minimap: 6 FPS

## Testing Framework

### Stress Testing
The game includes a comprehensive stress testing system:

#### Test Levels
- **Low**: 50 particles, 2 bot players
- **Medium**: 200 particles, 5 bot players, 20-30 objects
- **High**: 500 particles, 10 bot players, 50-75 objects
- **Extreme**: 1000 particles, 20 bot players, 100-150 objects

#### Test Hotkeys
- **F2**: Quick FPS test (10 seconds)
- **F3**: Quick memory test (15 seconds)
- **F4**: Medium stress test (1 minute)
- **F5**: High stress test (2 minutes)
- **F6**: Stop current test
- **F7**: Manual memory cleanup
- **F8**: Toggle performance mode
- **F9**: Get detailed performance report
- **F10**: Request server performance stats

### Performance Metrics
Each test provides:
- Average FPS during test
- Memory usage statistics
- Network latency measurements
- Test duration and crash detection
- Performance recommendations

## Server Optimizations

### Adaptive Update Rate
- Monitors server FPS and adjusts update rate
- Scales from 60 FPS down to 20 FPS under load
- Automatic performance mode switching

### Memory Efficiency
- Object pooling on server side
- Delta compression for state updates
- Efficient collision detection algorithms

### Network Efficiency
- Reduced message frequency for non-critical updates
- Compressed data structures
- Player state interpolation

## Usage Instructions

### For Developers

1. **Enable Performance Monitoring**:
   ```javascript
   // In GameArena scene
   this.performanceMonitor = new PerformanceMonitor(this);
   ```

2. **Use Object Pools**:
   ```javascript
   // Get particle from pool
   const particle = this.objectPool.get('trailParticle');
   // ... use particle ...
   // Release back to pool
   this.objectPool.release(particle);
   ```

3. **Monitor Performance**:
   ```javascript
   const stats = this.performanceMonitor.getAverageStats();
   console.log('FPS:', stats.avgFps);
   ```

### For Testing

1. **Run Quick Tests**:
   - Press F2 for quick FPS test
   - Press F3 for memory test

2. **Run Stress Tests**:
   - Press F4 for medium stress test
   - Monitor performance during test
   - Press F6 to stop and get results

3. **Manual Testing**:
   - Use performance test HTML page
   - Monitor real-time performance metrics
   - Review recommendations

## Performance Targets

### Minimum Requirements
- **FPS**: â‰¥20 FPS (playable)
